<p>üöÄ Imagine a world where technology not only simplifies our lives but also solves some of our most pressing challenges. This vision drives me every day as the Founder of IrusSoft and Director and CEO of NextChainX. With over a decade of experience as a web artisan, I am passionately building an empire centered around AI and Blockchain technologies, creating sustainable solutions for real-world problems.</p>

<p>üíº My journey in the tech industry began with a fascination for coding, which quickly evolved into a career dedicated to leading and developing cutting-edge software products. Before founding IrusSoft, I served as the Head of the Software Department at MobiTising, where I spearheaded innovation and excellence in software development.</p>

<p>My expertise spans a vast array of technologies and tools, enabling me to craft robust and scalable solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend & Databases:</strong> JavaScript | Node.js | MySQL | NoSQL | Docker | Apache | Nginx | Laravel | PHP | HardHat | Alchemy | Remix | Solana | BNB | Ethereum</li>
  <li><strong>Frontend & User Experience:</strong> React.js | Vue.js | Nest.js | Next.js | Express.js | Web3.js | Ethers.js | Solana.js</li>
</ul>

<p>üåü My passion for exceptional user experiences has driven me to master the latest frameworks and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. This journey has taken me deep into the realms of Web3, Blockchain, and NFTs, where I have successfully minted real-world NFTs and played pivotal roles in creating NFT marketplaces. My work with Smart Contracts, ERC721, ERC20, EIP721, and ERC1155 tokens demonstrates my commitment to pioneering technological advancements.</p>

<p>üèÜ Throughout my career, I have made significant contributions to various esteemed software houses, consistently delivering exceptional solutions and earning recognition through award-winning projects like Koyal.pk. My dedication to innovation extends beyond the corporate world; I have actively supported startups, helping them scale and achieve remarkable business growth.</p>

<p>üë• One of my proudest achievements is assembling and guiding a dynamic team of over 15 developers, fostering collaboration and excellence in every project. Together, we have brought numerous impactful projects to life, including Hamarieducation.com, a real-world incarnation of Wall-E.</p>
